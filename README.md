# QR CODE GENERATOR
This program is for the people who don't want to rely on websites to make a qr code that when scanned, it will pass through their website first before getting to the site you want.
This qr code generator makes a qr code that goes DIRECTLY to the site you want.

This is a very simple program to run.
all you need to do is paste the link when it asks for it, and then it will ask for the file name!
# MAKE SURE TO ADD ".png" AT THE END OF THE FILE NAME!!!!!

This program is not malicous in any way.
If you would like to check for yourself, you can check the source code for the file named "qrcode_maker.py".

Another way to check is to upload the file to https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload
